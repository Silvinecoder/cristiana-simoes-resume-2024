      <h3>About Me:</h3>
      <p>
        I am currently a software developer, but my true passion lies in
        composing music for video games, television, and film. With a strong
        foundation in music theory and composition, supported by both a
        bachelor's and a master's degree, Iâ€™ve been creating music for over a
        decade. Music has been a constant presence in my life, offering solace
        in difficult times and amplifying moments of joy. Now, I am eager to
        refine my skills in composition and sound design to craft innovative and
        unforgettable music that resonates with others. My ultimate dream is to
        become a full-time composer, bringing excitement and emotion to
        audiences through my work.

          For my masters degree in audio engineering, we had to mix and master
          tracks for our fellow students in ProTools and Logic Pro X. This was a
          great opportunity to learn how to work with different genres and
          styles of music. I was able to work with a variety of artists and help
          them achieve the sound they were looking for.

              I applied extensive equalisation (EQ) to clean up and remove noise
              from the recording, ensuring clarity and balance in the sound.
              Additionally, I experimented with various microphone placements,
              including positioning a microphone outside the recording room.
              This setup allowed me to capture the natural reverb of the
              hallway, adding depth and an authentic spatial quality to the
              overall production.

              I extensively utilised panning and fader adjustments to craft a
              dynamic sense of space, ensuring that each voice and instrument
              was distinctly positioned within the mix, creating clarity and
              depth.

              Distortion was a key element of this track, so I focused on
              carefully managing it to preserve the energy while minimising any
              unwanted harshness. I used a combination of EQ to effectively
              eliminate background noise and applied precise gain staging to
              ensure optimal levels across both analog and digital equipment
              throughout the production process. This approach prevented
              clipping and maintained the track's integrity.

          I created numerous tracks for my own enjoyment and to refine my skills
          as a composer.

          Hereâ€™s what I composed:

          <li>
            CyberNight was originally composed for an indie game that was in
            development but ultimately cancelled. The track is a dark synth
            piece designed to evoke tension and suspense within a boss fight. It
            was produced in Studio One using custom presets I created in XFER
            Serum, along with other synthesizers.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Ritual of the Samurai was done with reference of Japanese video
            games like Castlevania, so I could learn between musical skills in
            classical and modern music. With baroque and groovy styles for
            momentum.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are a few things I could improve on in this track. I feel like
            it's too much without a clear repetitiveness.

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Mastered Bolt is a funk track, with fun groovy elements. The track
            was made for the game Sol705, a point and click adventure game.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are many aspects of this track that I could improve. The
            recording quality wasn't ideal, as it wasn't done in the same room,
            resulting in a somewhat unbalanced sound.

            These two tracks were a challenge to create, as I aimed to craft fun
            and groovy compositions with a lofi vibe. At the time, I was
            listening to a lot of lofi and Daft Punk music and wanted to capture
            a similar spatial sound.

          I started arranging music during my undergraduate degree and have
          continued to do so, consistently working to develop my orchestration
          skills across different genres and styles. To enhance my
          understanding, I created notation and arrangements by ear to learn how
          each track was composed.

            Octopath Traveler was one of my favorite orchestral tracks, and I
            wanted to understand how the power of the brass was achieved. I
            would recreate the notation by ear and then develop the track in
            Logic Pro, using various libraries to capture the right sound.
          </li>
          <li>
            If I had the chance to do it again, I would have used a variety of
            string and brass libraries to create a more powerful effect.

            This is another grand orchestral track, powered by the harmony of
            the strings and the intensity of the percussion. Recreating it took
            me a month, but it was well worth the effort, as it provided an
            excellent opportunity to understand the importance of strength in
            orchestral music within a fantasy setting.
          </li>
          <li>
            If I were to do it differently, I would have used the new libraries
            from Musescore, incorporated more dynamics to achieve a more
            emotional sound of the strings and the power for the percussion.

            Yoko Shimomura is one of my favorite composers, and I wanted to take
            on the challenge of recreating a beautiful Disney-inspired track.
            Using Logic Pro and EW libraries, I focused on capturing the
            richness of the spatial sound to bring the piece to life.

            The goal of recreating this track was to work on mastering
            repetition, a challenge I often face in my own compositions. I tend
            to include too many ideas, which can sometimes make the track feel
            cluttered or confusing. Through this project, I aimed to learn how
            to use repetition effectively while still keeping the listener
            engaged.
