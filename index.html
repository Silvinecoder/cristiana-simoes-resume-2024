      <h3>About Me:</h3>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m a software developer whose enjoyed the excitement of building
        applications for both the web and on mobile that bring people together
        and creating resilient microservices that make the security sector a
        safer place. When I'm not solving puzzles at work, you can usually find
        me immersed in my own projects. Lately, I've been building video games,
        and developing an app aimed at helping people with celiac disease
        quickly find the products they need. My passion lies in expanding my
        skills in software architecture and crafting solutions that are as
        innovative as they are reliable.

        <p>
          As a software developer at The Keyholding Company, I work within an
          agile team to transform our monolithic service into a microservices
          architecture, enabling expansion in mobile security services and
          creating job opportunities for officers to secure properties. <br />
          Hereâ€™s what I developed:
        </p>
        <div class="experience_expanded">
          <p><strong>Microservices Development:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Expanded the monolithic system, by extracting into microservices
              while maintaining the monolith as a centralised data service. This
              improves the reliability and security of the system, as well as
              the user experience of management navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Led the overall strategic direction of the Nessa microservice
              development, which enhances the management of jobs, observations,
              and property logs. This service also empowers EY to monitor the
              status of their offices and address any emerging issues.
            </li>
            <li>
              Co-lead engineer on the Task-Master and Exception-Manager
              services. Task-Master tracks property-related items, enabling task
              self-mobilization, while Exception-Manager triggers actions based
              on user-defined rules for broadcast events.
            </li>
            <li>
              Collaborated on the development of the Hutten service by expanding
              its models and endpoints. Hutten is a tool that eliminates the
              need for advanced risk training by digitalizing threat assessments
              and providing a visual representation of an organization's risk
              appetite.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Team Management and Planning:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Contributed to the architectural design and swim lanes of service
              flows using Miro for visual planning and structure.
            </li>
            <li>
              Estimated service timelines, organized sprints, and created
              detailed tickets for each phase. While establishing a new
              ticket-writing standard based on the "What, Why, and How"
              approach.
            </li>
            <li>
              Onboarded 4 new team members to our microservice Nessa, offering
              guidance through detailed presentations and pair programming
              sessions.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>System Programming:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Collaborated on building Bedrock; a lightweight framework for
              microservices, enabling rapid development of RESTful APIs with
              Kafka support.
            </li>
            <li>
              Extended our Java-based monolith to support JavaScript and Python,
              allowing data scientists to perform auditing and analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
              Contributed to the implementation of unit, integration and postman
              tests in our microservices to ensure code quality and stability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed a CodeExecutor worker to dynamically execute JavaScript
              code from a database via AWS Lambda, supporting event-driven,
              real-time processing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Created Bash, Python and YAML scripts within our microservices.
              One of the scripts is to convert client-provided Excel data, into
              SQL format for seamless insertion into our PostgreSQL database.
              Another script includes migrations for our data models.
            </li>
            <li>
              Led pipeline management with Github workflows to automate testing
              and deployment across environments. Featuring a blue/green
              deployment strategy for smooth, simultaneous rollouts.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>AWS Integration:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Enhanced services by integrating AWS Lambda and Kafka to
              facilitate data exchange between microservices and the monolithic
              system. Using terraform to manage our infrastructure as code.
            </li>
            <li>
              Configured Datadog, OpenTelemetry, and CloudWatch in our Lambda
              functions for monitoring and error analysis.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Documentation:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Implemented automatic documentation in Bedrock that generates API
              usage instructions for new endpoints, providing frontend engineers
              with essential data and endpoint details.

            consistency and an intuitive user experience across all app screens.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Testing Development:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Led the overhaul of testing in Jest and Enzyme, focusing on user
            interaction flows and screen functionality. This ensured confidence
            in our code base.
          </li>
          <li>
            Created RESTful APIs in Node.js to handle user data and
            interactions. Ensuring security within our users, so scammers were
            blocked from the app.
