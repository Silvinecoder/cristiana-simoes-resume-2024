      <h3>About Me:</h3>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m a software developer whose enjoyed the excitement of building mobile
        apps that bring people together and creating resilient microservices
        that make the security sector a safer place. When I'm not solving
        puzzles at work, you can usually find me immersed in my own projects.
        Lately, I've been building video games, and developing an app aimed at
        helping people with celiac disease quickly find the products they need.
        My passion lies in expanding my skills in software architecture and
        crafting solutions that are as innovative as they are reliable.

        <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
        <div class="location-date">

          <h4>July 2023 - present</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          As a software developer at The Keyholding Company, I worked within an
          agile team to transform our monolithic service into a microservices
          architecture, enabling expansion in mobile security services and
          creating job opportunities for officers to secure properties. <br />
          Hereâ€™s what I developed:
        </p>
        <div class="experience_expanded">
          <p><strong>Microservices Development:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Developed microservices to enhance our monolithic architecture,
              improving performance and scalability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Took on the responsibility for defining the overall strategic
              direction of the Nessa microservice development, which enhances
              the management of jobs, observations, and property logs. This
              service also empowers EY to monitor the status of their offices
              and address any emerging issues.
            </li>
            <li>
              Partnered with the Lead engineer on the Task-Master and
              Exception-Manager services. Task-Master tracks property-related
              items, enabling task self-mobilization, while Exception-Manager
              triggers actions based on user-defined rules for broadcast events.
            </li>
            <li>
              Collaborated on the development of the Hutten service by expanding
              its models and endpoints. Hutten is a tool that eliminates the
              need for advanced risk training by digitalizing threat assessments
              and providing a visual representation of an organization's risk
              appetite.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Team Management and Planning:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Contributed to the architectural design and swim lanes of service
              flows using Miro for visual planning and structure.
            </li>
            <li>
              Estimated service timelines, organized sprints, and created
              detailed tickets for each phase.
            </li>
            <li>
              Onboarded 4 new team members to our microservice Nessa, offering
              guidance through detailed presentations and pair programming
              sessions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Organized daily stand-ups and sprint sessions to align team goals.
            </li>
            <li>
              Established a new ticket-writing standard based on the "What, Why,
              and How" approach.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Framework Development:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Built Bedrock, a lightweight framework for microservices, enabling
              rapid development of RESTful APIs with Kafka support.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>System Programming:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Extended our Java-based monolith to support JavaScript and Python,
              allowing data scientists to perform auditing and analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented unit and integration testing in our microservices to
              ensure code quality and stability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed a CodeExecutor worker to dynamically execute JavaScript
              code from a database via AWS Lambda, supporting event-driven,
              real-time processing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Created Bash and Python scripts within our microservices,
              including a script to convert client-provided Excel data into SQL
              format for seamless insertion into our PostgreSQL database.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wrote YAML migration scripts to modify or add new database models.
            </li>
            <li>
              Set up a GitHub workflow to automate testing and deployment across
              environments.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented a blue/green deployment strategy for smooth,
              simultaneous rollouts.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>AWS Integration:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Enhanced services by integrating AWS Lambda and Kafka to
              facilitate data exchange between microservices and the monolithic
              system.
            </li>
            <li>
              Configured Datadog, OpenTelemetry, and CloudWatch in our Lambda
              functions for monitoring and error analysis.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Documentation:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Each microservice includes a README with service details.</li>
            <li>
              Implemented automatic documentation in Bedrock that generates API
              usage instructions for new endpoints, providing frontend engineers
              with essential data and endpoint details.
