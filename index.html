      <h3>About Me:</h3>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m a software developer whose enjoyed the excitement of building mobile
        apps that bring people together and creating resilient microservices
        that make the security sector a safer place. When I'm not solving
        puzzles at work, you can usually find me immersed in my own projects.
        Lately, I've been building video games, and developing an app aimed at
        helping people with celiac disease quickly find the products they need.
        My passion lies in expanding my skills in software architecture and
        crafting solutions that are as innovative as they are reliable.

        <h2>The Keyholding Company</h2>
        <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
        <div class="location-date">
          <h4>London</h4>
          <h4>July 2023 - present</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          As a software developer at The Keyholding Company, I worked within an
          agile team to transform our monolithic service into a microservices
          architecture. This transition allowed us to expand our mobile security
          services and create job opportunities for officers to support
          companies in keeping their properties secure. <br />
          Hereâ€™s what I developed:
        </p>
        <div class="experience_expanded">
          <p><strong>Microservices Development:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Developed microservices to extend our existing monolithic
              architecture, establishing new practices to improve performance
              and scalability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Took on the responsibility for defining the overall strategic
              direction of the Nessa microservice development, which enhances
              the management of jobs, observations, and property logs. This
              service also empowers EY to monitor the status of their offices
              and address any emerging issues.
            </li>
            <li>
              Collaborated with the Lead software engineer to develop the
              Task-Master and Exception-Manager services. Task-Master tracks
              outstanding property-related items, such as tasks and issues, and
              enables self-mobilization through its task functionality.
              Exception-Manager listens for events broadcast by our systems and,
              when a configured event matches a user-defined rule, it triggers
              one or more actions created by the user.
            </li>
            <li>
              Collaborated on the development of the Hutten service by expanding
              its models and endpoints. Hutten is a tool that eliminates the
              need for advanced risk training by digitalizing threat assessments
              and providing a visual representation of an organization's risk
              appetite.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Team Management and Planning:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Contributed to the architectural design and swim lanes of service
              flows using Miro for visual planning and structure.
            </li>
            <li>
              Estimated the timeline for developing new services, breaking it
              down into sprints and defining individual tickets for each phase.
            </li>
            <li>
              Onboarded 4 new team members to our microservice Nessa, offering
              guidance through detailed presentations and pair programming
              sessions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Organized daily stand-ups and sprint planning sessions to maintain
              team cohesion and ensure that each developer was aligned with our
              project goals.
            </li>
            <li>
              Established a new standard for writing tickets expanding on the
              "What, Why, and How" methodology.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Framework Development:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Built a lightweight framework called Bedrock, which serves as the
              foundational template for all our microservices, enabling rapid
              development of RESTful APIs with built-in Kafka support
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>System Programming:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Extended our Java-based monolithic service to support multiple
              languages, including JavaScript and Python, enabling data
              scientists to use it for auditing and data analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented unit and integration testing in our microservices to
              ensure code quality and stability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed a CodeExecutor worker that dynamically retrieves and
              executes JavaScript code from a database, leveraging AWS Lambda to
              process event-driven inputs. This enables flexible, real-time code
              execution tailored to incoming events.
            </li>
            <li>
              Created Bash and Python scripts within our microservices,
              including a script to convert client-provided Excel data into SQL
              format for seamless insertion into our PostgreSQL database.
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed YAML migration scripts to modify or add new models in
              our database.
            </li>
            <li>
              Set up a GitHub workflow to automate testing and deployment across
              different environments.
            </li>
            <li>
              Established a blue/green deployment strategy to enable seamless,
              simultaneous deployments.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>AWS Integration:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Enhanced our services by integrating AWS Lambda and Kafka to
              enable microservices to communicate with the monolithic system and
              exchange relevant data.
            </li>
            <li>
              Configured Datadog, OpenTelemetry, and CloudWatch within our
              Lambda functions for effective monitoring and error analysis of
              our microservices.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Documentation:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Each microservice includes a README file with detailed information
              about the service.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented an automatic documentation generator in Bedrock that
              provides API usage instructions whenever a new endpoint is created
              in a microservice. This tool generates detailed information for
              our frontend engineers on how each endpoint works and the expected
              data.

            user interaction flows and screen functionality.
